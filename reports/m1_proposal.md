Our dashboard will have a landing page consisting of three main sections. On the left, there will be a sidebar menu with various filtering options, including filters for program type, cost, and location. On the right will be the main content area. The top row will display summary statistics about food programs in Vancouver, such as the total number of programs, average cost, and program status. Below this will be the main visualization area, dominated by a map of Vancouver. The map will include markers showing the locations of food programs, and users can click on a marker to view more information about a program. To the right of the map, there will be graphs and charts displaying counts, trends, and distribution information for the selected food programs.
